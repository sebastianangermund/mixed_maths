# Model
```collatz.py``` models the mathematics described in the tex paper under ```latex/```. We can generate the inverse tree graph, visualize and keep track of things like path densities by running its different funtions. Use ```controller.py``` as a playground and don't edit the model code.

# Requirements
Python requirements are listed in ```requirements.txt``` but you also need to install graphviz. On a mac: ```brew install graphviz```.
